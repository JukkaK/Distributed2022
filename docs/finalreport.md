## Design Principles

__TODO: Jukka__

The aim of the project was to develop a skeleton of a webshop system with public cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) components. We chose Microsoft Azure as the platform as one of project members had previous experience on using it, though not actually implementing a distributed system. With this in mind, we set on exploring what PaaS services would fit the project, with clear understanding the the architecture we ended up with might not be one we designed at the start. We did, however, had quite a clear though of the architectural layers we were going to implement and the languages to be used.

In whole, the architecture pattern used can be best though as a modular monolith - a service made of multiple components that can be changed to use different services if needed, but not implementing a microservice pattern where, for example, each node would be represented by a self-sustained service with it's own data layer. Implementing a microservice would require more considerantion of the lifecycle of each invidual service, including things like fault tolerance, which we felt to be a too large undertaking.

### Architecture

### Frontend layer

The frontend layer representing a simple webshop was to be implemented as a single page app (SPA) with React framework that would fetch data for the webshop from the data layer, and initiate updates by send asynchronous messages to the middleware messaging layer. 

We chose Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) as the PaaS service to be used and had no reason to change it during the implementation phase, even if we did stumble into several limitations concerning the integration with messaging layer. SWA is actually made of two different services; hosting of the SPA application and hosting of a backend function, which is a limited version of an Azure Function Application. One of the limitations is that the backend function only supports http-binding for the function, and it is mainly meant to be used between the SPA and the backend function itself. Implementing a messaging integration, however, requires an outbound binding to the messaging layer, which the backend function does not support (which is not really documented well). We went around this limitation by implementing the messaging integration by using Azure nodejs npm-package for the messaging server, which is a bit of a messy way of implementing the integration, but works well enough for demonstration purposes. The more elegant way would have been not to deploy the backend function at all, but either to implement the integration directly to the SPA, or by deploying a separate Azure Function App to handle the messaging integration (which would have required a preminium offering of the SWA).

### Messaging layer

Selecting the PaaS service for the messaging layer was, from architectural viewpoint, one of the most demanding tasks of the project. Azure basically has two services that can both handle the messaging: _Azure Event Grid_ which is meant for doing integration with lightweight messages, and _Azure Service Bus_ which is meant for business-critical messages with possibility of larger payloads.

We ended up using _Service Bus_ as it implements a lot of the features required from the project. With Service Bus, we use a simple _queue_ where frontend application pushes messages, and to which our distributed worker nodes subscribe to. Our Service Bus queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) paradigm, which means that it's pretty dumb; messages pushed to the queue retain their order of appearance, and they are served out in that same order. Subscribed services consume the messages with the fastest-wins -principle.

Service Bus supports even more fault tolerant messaging options, like peek-locking, meaning that a subscribed service first reads a message from the queue and reserves it so that competing services are not able to read it. After completing it's transaction, it then deletes the message from the queue, and if the transaction for some reason fails, queue releases the message back for others to consume after a configurable period of time. Unfortunately our chosen implementation language (javascript) did not support this feature yet.

### Distributed layer

We chose our transaction layer to be the distributed part of the system and ended up having an X amount of distributed worker nodes that consume messages from messaging layer and perform the update operations agains the data layer. We have a single worker implementation and deploy it to multiple Azure Function Apps that are geographically distributed. Worker application has an inbound Service Bus binding that is configured to listen to the Service Bus Queue. When messages appear in the queue, a function is triggered, the function reads the message and subsequently calls the data layer to perform an update transaction with the details gathered from the message payload. After completion the function stops, and is triggered again when the next message is picked up from the queue.

### Data layer

We chose Azure Cosmos DB as our data storage option, as it is a global distributed service. The initial architectural decision was to use it only in a single region, with the option to fan it out to the same regions our worker nodes are in, if time permits trying that out.

Our Cosmos DB acts as a document storage with MongoDB API as implementation option. MongoDB was chosen because one of our team members was familiar with it. On top of it, we implemented a simple database api that also runs in an Azure Function application. 

### Logging

We use Azure Application Insights as to log and debug our function apps. Every function app is connected to the same Application Insight -instance and provide logging that goes through the layers, which the exception of the message layer, where we use Service Bus metrics to observe the amount of messages passing through the queue.

## Functionalities

__TODO: Ville__

3. What functionalities does your system provide? For instance, naming and node discovery,
consistency and synchronization, fault tolerance and recovery, etc? For instance, fault tolerance
and consensus when a node goes down.

### Naming and node discovery

The distributed nodes of the application are implemented as Azure Functions, which get their own unique address upon creation, like [https://func-distributed-backend-ne-001.azurewebsites.net](https://func-distributed-backend-ne-001.azurewebsites.net), and singular functions hosted in the same app can be found under _/api/functionname_, with a function secret key appended after the url. So discovery, should there be any direct function-to-function -calls, in the simplest form would be just hardcoding the full urls of other functions with their secret keys, and you are good to go.

However, when using PaaS services as messaging layer, the usual way of node discovery is that nodes themselves subscribe to the messaging services. The usual way of doing this is using some sort of connection string that includes the secret key of the messaging service. In case of Service Bus, the connection string format is:

```
Endpoint=sb://sb-distributed-we-001.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=secretkeygoeshere
```

This of course means that when adding a new node to the system, the node has to know the connection string of the messaging service (and on function level, the name of the queue that the function binds to). To automate this phase of discovery, we have implemented creation of the service bus and worker nodes with infrastrucure-as-code -approach. The service bus creation outputs the connection string and the iac module that creates function apps takes the connection string as an input parameter and creates a function app configuration key-value -pair of it.

```
output serviceBusConnectionString string = listKeys(serviceBusEndpoint, sb.apiVersion).primaryConnectionString
```
```
module workersNE 'funcapp.bicep' = {
  scope: backendNeRg
  name: 'backendNe'
  params: {
    location: 'northeurope'
    cosmoscs: cosmosdb.outputs.cs
    serviceBusConnectionString: servicebus.outputs.serviceBusConnectionString
    aiKey: ai.outputs.aiKey
    appName: 'backend'   
  }
}
```

In real-life scenario, one should never pass secret values as outputs in iac-code, as they tend to show up in deployment logs. The current preferred way of doing this configuration in Azure would be not to use secret keys at all, but to enable a _managed identity_ in the function apps, that would be authorized to access the Service Bus. A managed identity is basically a service identity created for a service in the Azure Active Directory Tenant used. But using classic connection strings is probably more illustrative way of doing this for the purposes of this project.

### Fault Tolerance

In order to understand fault tolerance in Azure public cloud, there are several key concepts that need to be understood first.

__Regions__ are the basic units of fault tolerance; they are geographical units of deployment and under the hood, they are made up of at least three paired datacenters in different physical locations. For example, the upcoming _Finland_ region in Azure will have three physically separate datacenters in around western Uusimaa.

__Availability Zones__ are the logical units inside a region, each made up of one or more datacenters. Finally, inside data centers there are __fault domains__ and __upgrade domains__ that make up the physical level of fault tolerance.

For the purposes of this project, we can assume that our services would survive anything short of a regional outage with minimal downtime, as our deployment scope for the resources that are not duplicated (service bus, static web apps, data layer) is the __West Europe__ region.

Read more of the basic region/zone design [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview).

__TODO: Ville__

- Frontend, service bus, cosmos db+api: just a single instance of these currently deployed. Check from docs on the fault tolerance of those.
- Worker node: these are fault tolerant, which the exception of node going down when a function is executing. Maybe mention something about service bus nondestructive read/peek read here, and that nodejs does not yet support that?

### Synchronization and consistency

__TODO: Ville__

- I think we need to do some more implementation to either get this one, or get the shared distributed state working. Deploying regional dbapis and cosmosdb would probably be enough.



## Scalability and performance

Scaling in public cloud basically works in two different ways. 

You can __scale up__, meaning that you add more computing power to the instance you currently have. Azure services usually have a _sku_ (stock keeping unit) that one has to define when creating an instance of a service. Sku dictates multiple things; the amount of computing power (memory, etc) allocated to the service, the features available for the instance, and the price it costs - finding the correct sku is always a balancing act.

Scaling up and down is particulary hard for Azure Function Apps, as you are not only choosing the amount of computing power available. Function apps also have the concept of _plan_, which basically means how the function apps are hosted under the hood. The cheapest option is a _consumption_ plan, where the functions are spun when they receive a call. Other options would be a _preminium_ or a _dedicated_ plan, where the function apps would either have existing pre-warmed nodes all the time, or a dedicated web server with existing pre-warmed nodes. The disction between consumption nodes and pre-warmed nodes is that there is a lag on the startup of the former. There is no way to automate scaling up; if you are using consumption plan and want to avoid the cold startup lag, you need to create new function app resources. 

More about different plans and scaling [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale).

Other services we use also share the same idea of scaling up; they also get more features with skus that cost more, though with service bus and cosmos db scaling up also affects the throughput of the services. 

You can also __scale out__, which means that your services can be run on multiple instances. Plenty of Azure PaaS services support some sort of autoscaling, meaning that some kind of metric-based thresholds can be configured into them, and if load goes over those thresholds, the services automatically create more instances where the load is run. For example, function apps, with both consumption and preminium plan, scale up to a 100 instances.

Another way of scaling out is to create multiple nodes of a service on your own, as we have done with the worker nodes; we deploy them to three separate Azure Regions (West and North Europe, and East US) which balances the load, but of course introduces more latency to the system as the messages have to travel accross the globe. Each of these separate nodes could still scale out in their own, should we configure some kind of autoscaling for them.

With service bus, autoscaling would need a preminium plan, but with that autoscaling can be configured in pretty much similar way. See more about service bus namespace autoscaling [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/automate-update-messaging-units).

Static Web Apps don't scale out as such, so they clearly are a bottle neck of our application. With Single Page Apps, it does not really make sense to scale up or out the resource hosting the compiled pages, but if there would be performance with the frontend, the correct way would be to implement some kind of caching and delivery -solution with it. Azure offers several services for that, including Azure CDN or Azure Front Door. Though even implementing those leaves us with the Static Web App backend functions, which really is an issue, as you can't really do anything for those since they are a kind of under-the-hood-minimal-implementation of Azure Function App. Should there be any issus with performance of those backend functions, the correct way of addressing those would be to bump up the Static Web App sku to a paid standard-plan, which would allow us to host the backend functions in separate Azure Functions app that can be scaled as mentioned before. 

For the Data layer, Azure Cosmos DB is by nature an autoscaling and globally distributed NoSql database. Cosmos DB uses a metric called _Request Units_ (RU) to calculate all kinds of things, including the performance and pricing. As we initially had a single region deployment of both the Cosmos DB and the dBApi hosted in Azure Functions, the correct way of handling both the scaling and the availability of the services would be to deploy both in the same regions where the workers are deployed into, and configure the workers to use regional dbApis. This way, every region would work in a coherent way.
